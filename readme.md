## How I Built It:
this project is built with 100% html css, and javascript.

## Why I Built It:
buying the piano or online software cost you the most and have huge complpexity for begineers to overcome this issue i built this project.

What I Struggled With:
* The Web Audio API is so powerful but its also so confusing.
* The reverb was a whole other beast i have to create a fake room with math coz it was nuts.
* Making the recording playback timing was really hard and buggy at first.
* The visualizer was laggy at first i had to optimize it a lot to get it smoothest as possible.

What I have learned:
* The Web Audio API for making cool stuff in the browser.
* Learned how to generate and shape sound.
* CSS variables make theming so much fun and easy.
